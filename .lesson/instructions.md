# Instructions  

---

In this lesson, you will use React's `useEffect` hook
to contain a side effect. You'll make one fetch request
to [Free Geo IP](https://freegeoip.app/json/), a
publicly available API that converts an IP address
into a physical location. Then, you will show the 
city and state of the user on the screen.

If you want an extra challenge, modify the greeting
(Hi there/Howdy) to update based on the result of
the API call. Say 'Howdy' if the user is from Texas,
or say 'Hi there' otherwise.
